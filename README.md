# Final-code
I write all my code in google colab. its a python ipynb file.
I use 2 datasets in my code. One is from kaggle name Fish dataset. Dataset use with the help of API key. kagglee.json provided in Dataset folder.
Second dataset name weight dataset. That dataset provides information about fish weight is self generated with the help of kaggle dataset.
Kaggle dataset is only use for fish classification.
we have total 6 code file. 3 files name VGG-16-classification,Resne-50-classification and classification-Vgg19 are for fish classification.
For fish weight calculation code file name Weight-model-Resnet50.
For created new dataset code file name New-Dataset-Generate.
Final code for fish classification,weight calculation and calories calculation code file name Calories-and-Weight.
